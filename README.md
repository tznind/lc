## Features

### Persists changes to URL
Changes made to the character sheet update the url (address). Bookmarking or saving the address saves the current state of the character sheet.

This allows each player to keep track of their own state and share with others remotely by sending them the url

## Using it yourself

To create your own rule set with moves and roles, create a new repository using this as a template:

Then update [data.js](./data.js).

To see the page live ensure that GitHub Pages is enabled under Settings and visit your url:
